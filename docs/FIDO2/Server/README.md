## Preparations and Configurations

* Set up your FIDO2 server with HTTPS access enabled.
* Click "DOWNLOAD SERVER METADATA" to download metadata and register metadata to your server.
* Register your server URL at https://fidoalliance.co.nz/mds/ and add provided MDS endpoints to your server.
* Next find five URLs for MDS. Set up those five URLs to access from your server.
* Launch FIDO Conformance Tools and set your server URL into the text box below TESTS CONFIGURATION.

* If you want to capture network while testing, launch the inspector tool from Menu -> Open Inspector menu.

<img src="img/3.png" width="50%"/>

* Select the options you want to test.

## Run tests

* After completing these preparations and configurations, click the green "RUN" button.

## Test Results
* You can see the results of the tests at the top of the Tools screen.

<img src="img/6.png" width="80%"/>

* If the results do not indicate any failures found, find the red "SUBMIT RESULT" button on the bottom of the application screen.

<img src="img/7.png" width="50%"/>


## Submit Results

* Click the red "SUBMIT RESULT" button to submit your results to the FIDO Alliance.
* You need to run five test cases simultaneously to submit successful results. If you run five test cases separately, you will not see the red "SUBMIT RESULT" button even if your server passes all the test items.


## Test Items

* The list below describes mandatory test items (some lists are optional).
* The "P" in a number like "P-n" means the server should return the correct successful response.
* The "F" in a number like "F-n" means the server should return the correct error response.
